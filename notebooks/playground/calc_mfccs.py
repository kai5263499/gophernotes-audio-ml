# This python script preforms an MFCC analysis of every .wav file in a specified directory and saves the filterbank
# energies for each file in a new directory (as a .csv).
#
# Please note: running this script multiple times will overwrite earlier analyses
#
# Requires python_speech_features. Documentation: https://github.com/jameslyons/python_speech_features)
